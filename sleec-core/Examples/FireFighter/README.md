# Firefighting UAV case study
In this folder we provide SLEEC rules for the Firefighting UAV case study and an Eclipse project containing
a RoboChart model and SLEEC rules, that can be analysed by importing into SLEEC-TK.

## Contents
* `firefighter-initial.sleec`: initial elicited SLEEC rules.
* `firefighter-valid.sleec`: valid set of SLEEC rules after analysis.
* `robochart`: Eclipse project containing a RoboChart model and the relevant `.sleec` files for analysis,
   including conformance verification as specified in `.assertions` files.
